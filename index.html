        &emsp; Hi! I'm Sid. I studied bioinformatics, math,
        and computer science at UCSD. A couple of my hobbies are surfing,
        math, reading, and climbing. I'll be using this blog to showcase
        my work and thoughts.

    <h2>Influences and Inspirations</h2>
    <hr>
    &emsp; I've picked up a lot of my views about understanding the world
    and communicating from a couple of influential people. Here are
    just a few:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Steven Wittens' fantastic posts about 
            <a href='https://acko.net/blog/how-to-fold-a-julia-fractal/'>fractals</a> and 
            <a href='http://acko.net/blog/to-infinity-and-beyond/'>calculus</a> were among the
            reasons I developed a passion for math.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bret Victor has done a lot of
            <a href='http://worrydream.com/'>writing about better media
                for explanation and communication.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href='https://ncase.me'>Nicky Case has a blog</a> that puts
                a lot of these ideas into practice.
        </li>
        <li>
            Grant Sanderson's Youtube channel,
            <a href='https://youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw'>
                3Blue1Brown</a>, is also a great channel for intuitive explanations of
                of math.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        &emsp; I'm drawing from <a href='https://explorabl.es'>Explorables</a>
        here - first and foremost, I want this website to be about explanation
        through play. I've got a bunch of my own projects which I hope
        to turn into full-fledged explorables. <br>
        
        &emsp; Aside from being a creative outlet for me, some subordinate
        goals I have for this website are accessibility and design.
        First off, you'll notice that I'm writing this website in
        semantic HTML (to the degree that I can) in order to try to
        make this site accessible to those who use a screen reader,
        or a keyboard for navigation instead of a mouse. Often times
        in my previous work design has come at a cost to
        accessibility, which I hope to avoid on this site.
