                <h1>Abraham Wald</h1>
                <center><img src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/uploads/2411/images/2407150/Wald.jpg' /></center>
                <p>
                    &#09; Let's start with a story, because everybody loves stories.
                    </br></br>
                    &#09; Abraham Wald was a Jewish mathematician. Normally his ethnicity or religion wouldn't matter to the narrative, but we're telling a story here that starts in Central Europe in the late 1930's, so religion and ethnicity are the reasons that this story happened to begin with.
                    Wald immigrated to the United States, where the Cowles Commission for Research in Economics hired him. Once WWII began, he undertook work for the Center of Naval Analysis.
                </p>
                <!-- Picture of the returning planes here -->
                <center><img src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/uploads/2411/images/2407203/planes-1.png' /></center>
                <p>
                    &#09; At the Center for Naval Analysis, Wald was tasked with a war problem. Too many planes were being shot down by anti-aircraft weaponry. Although more armor could be put on the planes, this armor posed problems because it limited how far the planes could go. As a result, the Center faced an optimization problem.
                    They needed to find out where to put the armor on the planes so that with the smallest amount of additional armor, the largest number of planes could be saved.
                    Wald and the other data scientists at the Center for Naval Analysis first started by looking at where the planes were being shot. As seen in the picture above, they tended to be hit by bullets near the tail or the wings, but not near the cockpit. To any regular data scientist, this would have been sufficient evidence that more armor was needed in these areas.
                    However, Wald was no ordinary data scientist. He recognized that there was an asymmetry in the data. 
                </p>
                <!-- Picture of the non-returning planes here -->
                <center><img src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/uploads/2411/images/2407204/planes-2.png' /></center>
                <p>
                    &#09; All of the planes that were coming back were the ones that weren't being shot down, meaning that those that were were completely excluded from the data. Wald recognized this and realized that this asymmetry made perfect sense: If a pilot was killed, no one could fly the plane back. As a result, he told the Center to put more armor in the middle, near the cockpit of the plane.
                    </br></br>
                    Wald is a personal hero to me because his contribution to math directly and positively affected the real world. It wasn't just an abstract statement about the zeroes of functions or a new way to do calculus.
                </p>
                <h1>Motivations</h1>
                <h3>Politics</h3>
                <!-- Picture of Trump here -->
                <center><img src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/uploads/2411/images/2407215/trump.jpg' height='300px' width='400px' /></center>
                <p>
                    Modern day politics calls for a democratization of the field. It's why anti-establishment candidates like Trump and Bernie are so popular, and it also is a reminder of the popularity of Andrew Jackson as president. With these candidates, more people feel like their voices are being heard, and as a result, more people are becoming involved in politics and voting. In a vacuum, this is a completely good thing, because the more people come out to vote, the more democratic our system becomes.
                    </br></br>
                    However, when it comes to massive problems like our debt crisis and high unemployment rates, if people want to come to their own conclusions about how to solve these problems, they need "sturdy" tools to do their own analyses, and that's where math and science come in. Both of these tools need to be democratized because in their current forms, they can in many times be impractical or difficult to apply.
                </p>
                <h3>Freakonomics</h3>
                <!-- Picture of Freakonomics cover here -->
                <center><img src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/uploads/2411/images/2407279/freakonomics.jpg' height='444px' width='300px' /></center>
                <p>
                    The book Freakonomics also led me to start this project. It presents a model of completely rational decision making that is driven only by incentives, although some may be hidden, leading to a different decision than one might expect.
                    For example, it's well established that in professional soccer (football) games, during penalty kicks, shots to the center of the goal succeed way more often than shots to the sides of the goal. However, players tend to make fewer shots to the center of the goal than to the sides of the goals. The logical question here is, "Why?"
                    </br></br>
                    Turns up, the answer is a lot simpler than I expected at first. No, it's not some inception-style game of reverse psychology. Instead, imagine being a soccer player. If you kick the ball directly towards the center of the goal and the goalie catches it, what happens? You get booed by the crowd, maybe labelled a traitor. So there's a hidden negative social incentive that drives this inequity in soccer kick directions.
                    </br></br>
                    Anyways, back to math and science: Reading Freakonomics made me want to build a model to quantify these incentives, but when I looked at Wikipedia to see what existing models looked like, I realized, I just didn't have the math. When I attempted to independently investigate the math, I found out it was tough. Like, really tough. That's the second reason this blog was spawned.
                </p>
                <h3>New Journals</h3>
                <p>
                    The last event that directed me down this course was the introduction of a couple of new journals.
                    </br></br>
                    Sci-Hub technically isn't a journal. It's an archive of papers from journals, and I support the direction the creator of Sci-Hub is taking with it. Typical journals make profits off of papers by charging readers money if they want to read a paper that's younger than a year old. Most of this money gets funneled into the pockets of the organization that owns the journal, which is problematic because it means most of this recent research, which is often times funded by public money, isn't seen by the public until it's old stuff. Sci-Hub looks to change this trend by making papers available for free.
                    </br></br>
                    Discrete Analysis is a journal. Well, technically, it's not a whole journal either. It's a new user end for a pre-existing journal, arXiv. The reason it was created aligns pretty closely with Sci-Hub's. It's also meant to democratize a professional field, but it democratizes specifically the submission of research to journals.
                </p>
                <h1>Essential Question</h1>
                <p>I came up with the following essential question:</p>
                <h3>Can technology be used to better teach and understand math?</h3>
                <p>
                    In order to answer this question, however, we need to diagnose what is wrong with our current methods. As a result, I investigated the following question:
                </p>
                <h3>Why is math tough to begin with?</h3>
                <p>
                    First off, there's the issue of Notational Complexity. Take a look at the formal definition of a limit and you'll see what I mean:
                    $$\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L\Longleftrightarrow\left(\forall \epsilon > 0\right)\left(\exists\delta>0\right)\left(\forall x \in D\right)\left(0<|x-a|<\delta\Longrightarrow|f(x)-L|<\epsilon\right)$$
                    That's an eyesore.
                    </br>
                    Unfortunately, the words aren't much better. Here they are, in case you're curious: "\[\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L]\ implies that for all \[\epsilon]\ greater than 0, there exists a \[\delta]\ greater than 0 such that for all x in f's domain, when the distance between x and a is less than \[\delta]\, the distance between f(x) and L is less than \[\epsilon]\."
                    </br>
                    Point is: that's still horrible. What this jumble means is that when I say "\[\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L]\", I mean that you can make \[f(x)]\ arbitrarily close to \[L]\ if you let \[x]\ get arbitrarily close to \[a]\. In other words, if you give me a maximum error tolerance in the x and the y directions, I can always beat y's maximum error tolerance by making x closer to a.
                    </br>
                    I would be convinced that the complexity to limits is inherent to them, but the problem with that idea is that there are far simpler ways to express the crux of the idea behind a limit than by using the formal math notation.
                    </br>
                    The ultimate goal for this project is to remove the notational complexity of the math done here. I'm looking up to Brett Victor's website (<a href='http://setosa.io'>http://setosa.io</a>) and Steven Wittens' website (<a href='http://acko.net'>http://acko.net</a>) for inspiration because they do a great job of this.
                    </br></br>
                    The second issue I see with teaching math is the limits (hah) of technology. This sounds odd, because the whole point of this blog is to show that we can do things better using technology, but I'll explain.
                    </br>
                    If you were taking a precalculus class, you would likely see a requirement for a graphing calculator. This is what I mean. Graphing calculators are limited in many, many ways. For example, they can only graph functions of one variable. Secondly, they aren't very interactive. If you're trying to examine how, for example, the graph of \[x^3+y^3=r]\ changes as you change r, it's almost impossible to do on a graphing calculator. Sure, you can manipulate this equation algebraically to make it a function and then graph it for particular values of r, but even then you only get snapshots, or cross sections, of the bigger picture.
                    </br>
                    Enter Desmos. Desmos is a slightly enhanced, web version of a graphing calculator. However, these enhancements make it a powerful tool for gaining intuition. Want to graph relations that aren't functions? No problem. What about examining \[x^3+y^3=r]\ as r changes? Desmos has you covered too. I'm also looking up to Desmos, because it serves as a perfect playground for experimenting with math.
                    </br></br></br>
                    And that's what the aim of this blog is. I'm looking to democratize math (and, if possible, science too).
