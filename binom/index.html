                <h1>Notation</h1>
                <p>
                    The binomial theorem is insanely useful for doing things, but we have to clear up some notation before we can actually start discussing it. You might also know it as the "Choose" function, and that's for a very good reason, but we'll get to that later.
                    </br>
                    There are two ways to express "n Choose k". First, there's straight-up choose notation, \( \mathrm{ }_{n}C_k \). The second way to write the same statement is \( \binom{n}{k} \). On this blog you'll probably see it expressed via the second kind of notation.
                    </br>
                </p>
                <h1>Definition</h1>
                <p>
                    Binomial coefficients (also known as the choose function) is defined in the following way:
                    $$\mathrm{ }_n C_k=\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{(n!)((k-n)!)}$$
                    Notice that this doesn't mean anything useful yet. We'll eventually explain the definition, but don't worry about making sense of this definition right now.
                    There are, however, a couple <i>useful</i> definitions. The first is the most relevant: \( \binom{n}{k} \) tells us the number of different ways that you can choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) distinct elements. So, for example, if we had the set \( \{ A,B,C,D \} \), there are 6 ways to pick sets of two elements. Here, let's enumerate them just to prove it: \( \{A,B\} \), \( \{A,C\} \), \( \{A,D\} \), \( \{B,C\} \), \( \{B,D\} \), \( \{C,D\} \). Note that order doesn't matter, so , \( \{A,D\}=\{D,A\} \) and we don't count it twice.
