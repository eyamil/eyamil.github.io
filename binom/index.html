                <h1>Notation</h1>
                <p>
                    The binomial theorem is insanely useful for doing things, but we have to clear up some notation before we can actually start discussing it. You might also know it as the "Choose" function, and that's for a very good reason, but we'll get to that later.
                    </br>
                    There are two ways to express "n Choose k". First, there's straight-up choose notation, \( \mathrm{ }_{n}C_k \). The second way to write the same statement is \( \binom{n}{k} \). On this blog you'll probably see it expressed via the second kind of notation.
                    </br>
                </p>
                <h1>Definition</h1>
                <p>
                    Binomial coefficients (also known as the choose function) is defined in the following way:
                    $$\mathrm{ }_n C_k=\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{(n!)((k-n)!)}$$
                    Notice that this doesn't mean anything useful yet. We'll eventually explain the definition, but don't worry about making sense of this definition right now. Just notice that for the most part, this only makes sense with integer \(n\) and \(k\). (Turns up, this is a bit of a lie, because there's a function called the gamma function, \( \Gamma(x) \), that lets us find factorials of noninteger \(x\), but there's an easier way to do this that we'll cover later.)
                    There are, however, a couple <i>useful</i> interpretations. 
                </p>
                <h1>Pascal's Triangle</h1>
                <p>
                    The first is Pascal's Triangle. This is a nice way to compute values of a binomial coefficient, mainly because it's visual and concrete.
                    </br>
                    You've probably run into this before. Here's what it looks like:
                    </br>
                    \(0.\) <center>\( 1 \)</center></br>
                    \(1.\) <center>\(1 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1 \)</center></br>
                    \(2.\) <center>\(1 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 2 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1 \)</center></br>
                    \(3.\) <center>\(1 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 3 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 3 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1 \)</center></br>
                    \(4.\) <center>\(1 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 4 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 6 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 4 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1 \)</center></br>
                    \(5.\) <center>\(1 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 5 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 10 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 10 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 5 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1 \)</center></br>
                    If you want to find \( \binom{n}{k} \), just head over to the \(n\)'th row and grab the \(k-1\)'th number. 
                    </br>
                    And here's how you create it:
                    </br>
                    <center><img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/PascalTriangleAnimated2.gif' /></center>
                    </br>
                </p>
                <h1>The Choose function</h1>
                <p>
                    The second is the choose function: \( \binom{n}{k} \) tells us the number of different ways that you can choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) distinct elements. So, for example, if we had the set \( \{ A,B,C,D \} \), there are 6 ways to pick sets of two elements. Here, let's enumerate them just to prove it: \( \{A,B\} \), \( \{A,C\} \), \( \{A,D\} \), \( \{B,C\} \), \( \{B,D\} \), \( \{C,D\} \). Note that order doesn't matter, so \( \{A,D\}=\{D,A\} \) and we don't count it twice.
                </p>
                <h1>Use</h1>
                <p>
                    So now, the obvious question is: How is this useful?
                    </br>
                    The binomial coefficients show up incredibly often. Sometimes they can make what seem to be unexpected appearances, but I've found that their appearances are usually easy to make sense of. Anyways, enough rambling.
                    </br>
                    Say we had a power of a binomial. Let's do this symbolically instead of plugging in numbers: \( (a+b)^n \).
                    </br>
                    There's a nice and useful theorem called <b>the binomial theorem</b> that tells us the following:
                    $$(a+b)^n=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\binom{n}{k}a^{n-k}b^{k}$$
                    This compact representation of this theorem goes against pretty much every intention I wrote this blog with, but unfortunately I can't find a simple but concise way to explain it. As a bittersweet compromise, I'll offer some examples:
                    $$(a+b)^0=\binom{0}{0}a^0b^0=1$$
                    $$(a+b)^1=\binom{1}{0}a^1b^0+\binom{1}{1}a^0b^1=\textbf{1}a+\textbf{1}b$$
                    $$(a+b)^2=\binom{2}{0}a^2b^0+\binom{2}{1}a^1b^1+\binom{2}{2}a^0b^2=\textbf{1}a^2+\textbf{2}ab+\textbf{1}b^2$$
                    $$(a+b)^3=\binom{3}{0}a^3b^0+\binom{3}{1}a^2b^1+\binom{3}{2}a^1b^2+\binom{3}{3}a^0b^3=\textbf{1}a^3+\textbf{3}a^2b+\textbf{3}ab^2+\textbf{1}b^3$$
                    $$\cdots$$
                    </br>
                    You can probably see where the binomial is popping up: the coefficient before each term in the expanded polynomial is right from Pascal's Triangle. This is also why we sometimes refer to \(\binom{n}{k}\) as <i>the binomial coefficients</i>.
                    </br>
                    There are <i>tons</i> of places other than this that binomial coefficients show up, but a lot of the time, they're simply consequences of the binomial theorem.
                </p>
                <h1>Further Explanations</h1>
                <p>
                    After using the binomial theorem a couple of times, my mind was blown. The logical follow-up question seemed to be "Why does it work?"
                    </br>
                    Let's think about what's going on here for a bit using a specific case. First for some simplification:
                    $$(x+a)(x+b)(x+c)(x+d)=x^4+ax^3+bx^3+cx^3+dx^3+abx^2+acx^2+adx^2+bcx^2+bdx^2+cdx^2+abcx+abdx+acdx+bcdx+abcd$$
                    </br>
                    That's an eyesore. Here's something better:
                    $$(x+a)(x+b)(x+c)(x+d)=x^4+(a+b+c+d)x^3+(ab+ac+ad+bc+bd+cd)x^2+(abc+abd+acd+bcd)x+(abcd)$$
                    Something interesting that's become easier to notice as a result of our factorization is that the coefficient of \(x^{4-k}\) is the sum of the unique products (read: combinations) of \(k\) members of the set \( \{ a,b,c,d \} \). We can generalize this to more terms, but four should be enough to see the trend.
                    </br>
                    So in other words, the number of terms being added in the coefficient for \( x^{4-k} \) is \( \binom{4}{k} \).
                    </br>
                    Now, all that's left to do is to set \(a=b=c=d=q\).
                    $$(x+q)^4=x^4+(q+q+q+q)x^3+(qq+qq+qq+qq+qq+qq)x^2+(qqq+qqq+qqq+qqq)x+(qqqq)$$
                    We <i>could</i> go about this by combining like terms, but that would only prove this specific case. Instead notice that each term is now identical, so we can replace the sums with the coefficients we came up with earlier:
                    $$(x+q)^4=x^4+\binom{4}{1}x^3q+\binom{4}{2}x^2q^2+\binom{4}{3}xq^3+\binom{4}{4}q^4$$
                    We can easily extend this logic to all of the other cases, and understand why it happens to work for those.
                </p>
                <h1>Shortcuts?</h1>
                <p>
                    Back in my algebra 2 class, my teacher taught me about the binomial theorem via Pascal's Triangle and the combinations method. However, the problems we solved always involved expansion of binomials to some fairly large powers (e.g., 7).
                    </br>
                    Calculating each coefficient via the Choose Function is tedious, and for large powers, Pascal's Triangle quickly becomes inefficient. So let's look for a shortcut, one that lets us generate an entire row of Pascal's Triangle without having to worry about the preceding rows.
                    </br>
                    I caught onto this pattern by pure luck, so I'll give it away rather than deriving the pattern (partially because I don't know what the "logical" derivation is).
                    </br>
                    Say we're generating the 7th row of Pascal's Triangle:
                    $$\textbf{1}$$
                    We can extrapolate from the pattern that the first coefficient will always be one.
                    $$\textbf{1}\longrightarrow \textbf{7}$$
                    Again, from the pattern, we can extrapolate that the second coefficient will always be the power. Now we need to reverse engineer the pattern and try to find out what kind of function got us from 1 to 7. I like to think that the multiplication in the Choose Function hints to us that there's some kind of multiplication going on, but I can understand this being non-obvious, mainly because I only discovered it on a whim.
                    </br>
                    $$\textbf{1}\times\frac{7}{1}\longrightarrow \textbf{7}$$
                    From here, we're going to cheat a little bit. Let's look ahead to find out what the coefficients are, and then we'll rig our pattern to fit those coefficients. Turns up the next one's 21.
                    </br>
                    By reverse-engineering what just happened, we can figure out that we just multiplied by 3, but I'm going to write this in un-simplified terms to make the pattern more clear:
                    $$\textbf{1}\times\frac{7}{1}\longrightarrow \textbf{7}\times\frac{6}{2}\longrightarrow \textbf{21}$$
                    Now the pattern seems more obvious. Our "multiplier" has a numerator that's decreasing with every next coefficient and a denominator that's increasing with every next coefficient. Using this pattern, we'd predict the next coefficient to be \(21\times\frac{5}{3}=35\) and indeed, that's what it is. If you want to confirm that this pattern works for more coefficients, feel free to grab a pen and paper to do that. Also, what you'll notice is that once you reach the end of the row of the triangle, your last coefficient becomes 0, and the sequence of coefficients comes to an end naturally.
                    </br>
                    As a result, the far right hand side and the middle of this next statement are pretty much the same.
                    $$(a+b)^n=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}a^{n-k}b^k=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\binom{n}{k}a^{n-k}b^k$$
                    In the meantime, more interesting things lie ahead.
                </p>
                <h1>Extensions?</h1>
                <p>
                    If you're very astute, you might've noticed that in our shortcut, something fundamental has changed. In both the Choose Formula and Pascal's triangle, we can only ever get to integer rows. With Pascal's triangle, you're limited to positive-numbered rows, and with the Choose Formula, it's not possible to compute the factorial of something that's not a positive integer (again, this is technically a lie. Check out the wikipedia page for the Gamma function if you're curious).
                    </br>
                    However, our new formula knows no limits to what the "row number" (e.g., power) can be. We can pick a noninteger power, or even imaginary powers. Also, remember that equality from the "Shortcut" section? Well, that no longer holds. We can't just go to n when summing anymore, we have to sum all the way "down" to infinity.
                </p>
                <h1>Strange Consequences</h1>
                <p>
                    One of the multiple consequences of this extension is that all of a sudden, we have new ways to compute square roots.
                    The extension we've just come up with tells us the following:
                    $$\sqrt{1+x}=1+\frac{1}{2}x-\frac{1}{8}x^2+\frac{1}{16}x^3+\cdots$$
                    If you've taken some calculus you'll recognize this as a Taylor Series, and you'll also notice that it only converges when x is between -1 and 1. On its own, this is mildly interesting, but viewed more generally, all of a sudden, we have a new strange way to get Taylor Series, which is something I want to eventually investigate.
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    Another consequence, although admittedly less strange, is that it's all of a sudden much easier to derive formulas for \(\sin(n\theta)\) in terms of \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\).
                    </br> It all starts from here:
                    $$e^{i(n\theta)}=(e^{i\theta})^n$$
                    From here, we can replace the imaginary exponential with some trigonometric functions:
                    $$\cos(n\theta)+i\sin(n\theta)=(\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta))^n$$
                    And from here onward, all we need to do is expand the right hand side, and pick either just all of the imaginary terms (for \( \sin(n\theta) \)) or all of the real terms (for \( \cos(n\theta) \)).
                    </br>
                    When n is an integer, this is a finite sum, and lots of interesting results are abound. First, you'll notice that the polynomials you generate using this allow you to solve for \(\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{n}\right)\) and \(\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{n}\right)\), and with some extra manipulation it's possible to show that all trig functions of angles that are rational multiples of pi are algebraic numbers - as in, they can be expressed as roots of a polynomial.
                    </br>
                </p>
                <h1>The Header</h1>
                <p>
                    The last question that remains is "How's the header related?"
                    </br>
                    Turns up, if you take Pascal's Triangle and color all of the even coefficients white and color all of the odd coefficients black, you end up getting the picture in the header. It's a cool-looking fractal, and I was seriously out of things to use as headers, so I decided I'd make a simulation.
                </p>
                <h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>
                <p>
                    For this post, it was substantially tougher to use pictures, mainly because a lot of the work is algebra which can be tough to visualize in just 2 or 3 dimensions. However, from the feedback I recieved, this was also a more engaging topic, so I think I'll be sticking to these more often. Lastly, the library modifications I've had to make for this post have completely destroyed the waves post, so I don't think I'll be displaying it at Expo Night.
