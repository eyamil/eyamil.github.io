    Here's a list of some of the projects I feel comfortable about publishing.
    Note that some of these are still work in progress:
    <ul>
        {% for post in site.posts %}
            {% if post.category == "projects" %}
                <li>
                    <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
                    - {{ post.description }}
                </li>
            {% endif %}
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
